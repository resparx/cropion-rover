# Autonomous Agricultural Rover

An autonomous rover system designed for precision agriculture, capable of navigating crop rows and following planned paths using GPS guidance and computer vision.

## Features

- GPS-based navigation with Kalman filtering for improved accuracy
- Computer vision-based crop row detection and navigation
- Configurable path planning with coverage patterns
- Real-time position tracking and monitoring

## System Components

### Navigation
- Path planning with RRT algorithm
- Visual navigation using crop row detection
- Configurable geo-boundaries

### Sensors
- GPS module with filtering and validation
- Camera system for visual navigation and row detection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install numpy
   pip install adafruit-gps
   pip install pyserial
   ```

## Configuration

The system uses JSON configuration files located in the `config/` directory:
- `gps_config.json`: GPS module settings and filtering parameters
- `path_planner_config.json`: Path planning parameters

## Usage

1. Configure the GPS settings in `config/gps_config.json`
2. Run the main program:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```
